# Roadmap

## v1.0

Please find below a proposal for the Circuit UI v1.0 roadmap.

### Component APIs

- **[Input](/components/forms#input), [TextArea](/components/forms#textarea).**
  Today we have a number of props like `invalid`, `valid`, `showValid`, and
  `hasWarning`. Let's normalize them, perhaps as such:
    - valid (how to handle making "validness" visible?)
    - invalid
    - warning
- **Toggle.** It currently accepts an `onToggle` prop and
  then passes it on as an `onClick` prop to the underlying element. Let's
  make these the same and standardize on `onClick`.

### Conventions

- **Always use the same name for the components props as the standard React props
  or DOM props.** For example, always use `onClick` when that's what's getting
  passed to underlying components, rather than specialized names like
  `onSelect` or `onToggle`.
