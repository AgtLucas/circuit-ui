# Roadmap

## v1.0

Please find below a proposal for the Circuit UI v1.0 roadmap.

### Component APIs

- **`<Input>` and related components props.** Today we have a number
  of props like `invalid`, `valid`, `showValid`, and `hasWarning`. Let's normalize
  them, perhaps as such:
    - valid
    - invalid
    - warning
- **`<Toggle>` API.** It currently accepts an `onToggle` prop and
  then passes it on as an `onClick` prop to the underlying element. Let's
  make these the same and standardize on `onClick`.

### Conventions

- Always use the same name for the components props as the underlying values.
  For example, always use `onClick` when that's what's getting passed to
  underlying components, rather than specialized names like `onSelect` or
  `onToggle`.
